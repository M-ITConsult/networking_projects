# Networking Projects

Welcome to the Networking Projects repository! This repository contains various projects related to networking concepts, protocols, and applications. Below you'll find links to individual projects within this repository:

## Project Links

1. **[Mapping the Internet](./01_Network_Exploration)**  
   A simple test network connectivity using ping.

2. **[Packet Tracer - Navigating the IOS](./02_IOS)**  
   In this project, you will practice skills necessary for navigating the Cisco IOS, including different user access modes, various configuration modes, and common commands you use on a regular basis. You also practice accessing the context-sensitive Help by configuring the clock command.

3. **[Packet Tracer - Investigating the TCP/IP and OSI Models in Action](./03_Protocols)**  
   This project activity is intended to provide a foundation for understanding the TCP/IP protocol suite and the relationship to the OSI model. Simulation mode allows you to view the data contents being sent across the network at each layer.

4. **[Cisco Packet Tracer Projects](./04_Network_Access)**  
   These projects demonstrates a basic network setup in Cisco Packet Tracer. The setup will allow the two computers to communicate with each other over the network.

5. **[Cisco Packet Tracer Network Simulation](./Final_Project)**  
   This project is a network simulation created using Cisco Packet Tracer.
